    - noFill
    - line
    - ellipse
    - rect
    - background
    - stroke
    - fill
    - size

Write sketches to draw the following shape:

[![YouTube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/kPOFqXsLLeo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPOFqXsLLeo)

These require ONE loop:

![Sketch](images/p21.png)

This shape draws lines from the sides that all meet in the middle. This can be done using one loop, but is better with two:

![Sketch](images/p19.png)

This sketch always draws 10 equally sized circles across the screen. This should work no matter what you set the screen size to. You should also declare a variable to hold the number of circles to draw so that if you change this number, the sketch should still work:

![Sketch](images/p18.png)

This sketch places circles around the outside of a bigger circle to make a flower pattern. Once you figure this out, you can modify it to do something cool with colours:

![Sketch](images/p20.png)

This sketch prints the numbers of the clock around in a circle:

![Sketch](images/p22.png)

This sketch requires you to put one loop inside another and also use a boolean variable, though there are other ways to do this:

![Sketch](images/p23.png)

This is what it looks like when all the above code is in one sketch:

![Sketch](images/p24.png)

Try and draw this using ONE for loop:

![Sketch](images/p27.png)

Write a sketch that can draw regular polygons like squares, pentagons, octogons etc:

![Sketch](images/p10.png)

Write a sketch that can draw stars like these:
